    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Why did you make Mobile LotW?</h2>
    <p>
      Soon after I earned my General license in 2021 I became frustrated by how
      difficult it is to use the ARRL's
      <a
        href="http://lotw.arrl.org/"
        class="text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-700"
        >Logbook of the World</a
      >
      website on mobile phones. After waiting a few years for the ARRL to fix
      the problem, I decided to fix it for myself. Then, as I got into the
      project, I figured why not share my fix with others? The result is Mobile
      LotW.
