    <h2>Why did you make Mobile LotW?</h2>
    <p>
      Soon after I earned my General license in 2021 I became frustrated by how
      difficult it is to use the ARRL's
      <a href="http://lotw.arrl.org/">Logbook of the World</a> website on mobile
      phones. After waiting a few years for the ARRL to fix the problem, I
      decided to fix it for myself. Then, as I got into the project, I figured
      why not share my fix with others? The result is Mobile LotW.

    <h2>How does Mobile LotW work?</h2>
    <p>
      When you view a page in Mobile LotW, like the DXCC Award Info page, what
      happens behind the scenes is Mobile LotW downloads your DXCC Award Info
      page from LotW, reformats it to look nice on your phone, and then shows it
      to you. That's it!
    </p>

    <h2>Does Mobile LotW store my LotW password?</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile LotW does NOT store your LotW password. When you enter your LotW
      username and password into Mobile LotW and click the Login button, your
      username and password is used to log you into the LotW site in the
      background. Then the page you requested is downloaded and reformatted for
      your phone.
    </p>
